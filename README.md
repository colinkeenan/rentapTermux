# rentapTermux

rentapTermux is rentapBun modified to work with node instead of Bun for use in Termux on an Android device. (Bun can't currently be installed in Termux.) rentapTermux works in Termux for Android with or without a pre-existing store.json. It can use the same store.json created with rentapBun.
