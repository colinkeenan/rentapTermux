# rentapTermux

rentapTermux is rentapBun modified to work with node instead of Bun for use in Termux on an Android device. (Bun can't currently be installed in Termux.)
rentapTermux works in Termux for Android as long as store.json already exists: just copy it from rentapBun. At the moment, if store.json doesn't already exist, the button for creating Applying for options doesn't work for some reason, and that's a necessary first step to using this application.
